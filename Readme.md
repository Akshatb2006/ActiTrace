# 🚀 ActiTrace – Human Activity Recognition Platform

ActiTrace is an end-to-end Machine Learning system that performs Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensor data (accelerometer & gyroscope).  

The system allows users to:

- Upload wearable sensor sessions
- Automatically segment and extract features
- Run XGBoost-based activity classification
- Visualize activity timelines
- View session summaries and analytics
- Retrain and manage model versions

---

# 📌 Project Overview

ActiTrace bridges Machine Learning and full-stack application development.

It is built with:

- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind + Recharts
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **ML Layer:** XGBoost + scikit-learn
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Docker + AWS EC2

The system is designed to simulate an on-device activity classifier with an application layer.

# 🧠 Problem Statement

Modern wearable devices generate rich sensor data, but users and researchers lack:

- Transparent ML pipelines
- Explainable activity timelines
- Model version tracking
- Reproducible inference
- Session comparison capabilities

ActiTrace solves this by providing a complete ML lifecycle with visualization and version control.
